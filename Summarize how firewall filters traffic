Summarize how firewall filters traffic

A firewall filters traffic by monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network connections based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet). Firewalls evaluate each packet of data against rule sets, which define whether to allow, block, or restrict traffic based on criteria such as:

Port numbers (e.g., block Telnet on port 23, allow SSH on port 22)
IP addresses (source or destination)
Protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP)
Direction of traffic (inbound or outbound)

By doing so, firewalls help prevent unauthorized access, protect sensitive data, and maintain the security and integrity of a system or network.
